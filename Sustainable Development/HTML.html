          <h4>NO <span>POVERTY</span></h4>
          <p>As of 2015, about 736 million people still lived on less than US$1.90 a day; many lack food, clean drinking water and sanitation.
             Rapid growth in countries such as China and India has lifted millions out of poverty, but progress has been uneven. Women are 
             more likely to be poor than men because they have less paid work, education, and own less property.</p>

          <h4>ZERO <span>HUNGER</span></h4>
          <p>Unfortunately, extreme hunger and malnutrition remain a huge barrier to development in many countries. There are 821 
            million people estimated to be chronically undernourished as of 2017, often as a direct consequence of environmental
             degradation, drought and biodiversity loss. Over 90 million children under five are dangerously underweight. Undernourishment 
             and severe food insecurity appear to be increasing in almost all regions of Africa, as well as in South America.</p>

    <h4>QUALITY <span>EDUCATION</span></h4>
    <p>Since 2000, there has been enormous progress in achieving the target of universal primary education. The total enrollment rate
       in developing regions reached 91 percent in 2015, and the worldwide number of children out of school has dropped by almost half.
        There has also been a dramatic increase in literacy rates, and many more girls are in school than ever before. These are all 
        remarkable successes.</p>

       the 2008 economic crisis and global recession. In developing countries, the middle class now makes up more than 34 percent of
